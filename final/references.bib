	Abstract = {This article is the second of a two-part tutorial on visual servo control. In this tutorial, we have only considered velocity controllers. It is convenient for most of classical robot arms. However, the dynamics of the robot must of course be taken into account for high speed task, or when we deal with mobile nonholonomic or underactuated robots. As for the sensor, geometrical features coming from a classical perspective camera is considered. Features related to the image motion or coming from other vision sensors necessitate to revisit the modeling issues to select adequate visual features. Finally, fusing visual features with data coming from other sensors at the level of the control scheme will allow to address new research topics},

@article{Wilhelm00_LAIcorn,
	Abstract = {Measurement of leaf area index (LAI) is critical to understanding many aspects of crop development, growth, and management. Availability of portable meters to estimate LAI non-destructively has greatly increased our ability to determine this parameter during the cropping season. However, with several devices on the market, each with an independent set of protocols for gathering accurate estimates of LAI, it is necessary for scientists to have comparisons of these meters under field conditions before selecting one for purchase and use. The objective of our study was to compare the LAI estimates by three meters (AccuPAR, LAI-2000, and SunScan) to LAI measured by destructive sampling. Leaf area index of two corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids, grown on a Pachic Haplustoll, was measured at the R2 stage by the four methods before and after successive thinning of plant stands. Destructively sampled LAI ranged from 4.59 to 1.25 for the initial stand to the most severe thinning. Hybrids did not differ in LAI. All meters underestimated LAI compared with destructive sampling. When all data from all rings of the LAI-2000 meter were included in the calculations, LAI-2000 estimates of LAI differed from those of the other two meters. However, when data from Ring 5 was removed from the calculations, estimates of LAI for the LAI-2000 improved and were indistinguishable from the other meters. The relationship between LAI estimated destructively and by each of the meters was described by a unique linear equation for each hybrid. Results of this study, and experience with use of the meters, suggest that users should consider protocols for operating each meter before deciding which device best suits their application.},

@article{Martinez19cjar_tomatoModel,
	Abstract = {The HortSyst model is a new discrete time model for describing the dynamics of photo-thermal time (PTI), total dry matter production (DMP), N uptake (Nup), leaf area index (LAI), and evapotranspiration (ETc) for greenhouse crops. The first three variables are considered as state variables and the latter two are conceptualized as output variables. This model was developed as a tool for decision support systems in Mexican greenhouses for the application of N and water in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production. The HortSyst has 13 parameters. It was used to calibrate the model and estimate the correct parameter values for the crop season. An experiment was carried out to test model predictions in a greenhouse during the autumn-winter season in Chapingo, Mexico. Tomato `CID F1' was grown in a hydroponic system and plants were distributed with a density of 3.5 plants m-2. The tomato crop was transplanted on 21 August 2015. A weather station was installed inside the greenhouse to measure temperature, relative humidity, and global radiation. The HortSyst model provides an excellent predictive quality for DMP, Nup, LAI, and ETc according to the statistics. Values for bias (BIAS) were DMP (-3.897), Nup (-0.071), LAI (0.026), and ETc (3.647), values for root mean square error (RMSE) were DMP (14.543), Nup (0.500), LAI (0.100), and ETc (39.330), and values for modeling efficiency (EF)were DMP (0.996), Nup (0.991), LAI (0.998), and ETc (0.815). The model proposed and described in this paper can be integrated as a decision support tool for N supply and irrigation management in greenhouse production systems.

@article{Hu14rse_LAIcorrection,
	Abstract = {Accurate leaf area index (LAI) measurements are important for understanding and evaluating global mass and energy cycle. Foliage clumping serves an important function in traditional indirect LAI measurement methods. The clumping index has been used to modify effective LAI for decades. However, the change in path length within canopies is often the most uncertain factor in indirect LAI estimation using Beer's law. A simple clumping index is incapable of describing the heterogeneity of a canopy and may cause large errors in calculating true LAI values. We proposed a new LAI estimation method by using path length distribution functions in optical measurement. Both simulation and field measurements show that the path length-based method can effectively characterize the LAI values of heterogeneous canopies. Deviation is less than 10% for all the validations. One of the advantages of path length distribution theory is that it can characterize and handle crown shape-induced non-randomness within canopies. Such non-randomness, which may cause underestimation of up to 25%, has not been well addressed by existing algorithms. Path length theory is expected to improve the indirect measurement accuracy of LAI significantly with the use of current optical instruments.},

In this paper, we describe the basic techniques that are by now well established in the field. We first give a general overview of the formulation of the visual servo control problem. We then describe the two archetypal visual servo control schemes: image-based and position-based visual servo control. Finally, we discuss performance and stability issues that pertain to these two schemes, motivating the second article in the series, in which we consider advanced techniques},
